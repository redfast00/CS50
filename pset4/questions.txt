0.  BMP: varies (see the number of bits per pixel at offset 0x1C in the header)
         maximum is 2 ^ 32 
    GIF: palette of 256 different colors per frame, chosen from 2 ^ 24 colors + transparent
    JPEG: 2 ^ 24 different colors
    PNG: up to 2 ^ 48 different colors + alpha channel
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy: some information is lost in compression, so the original image can't be reconstructed
    Lossless: no information gets lost in compression or there is no compression
3.  JPEG and GIF
4.  The list of disk clusters the file occupies will be removed from the File Allocation Table
    (This doesn't mean the file is actually deleted, only the pointer to the file is deleted)
5.  - Overwrite the file with zero's or random bytes. (This only works well on a HDD)
    - Send the command to wipe the encryption key on a self-encrypting drive.
    - Destroy the drive (for example: hit it with a hammer, degauss it, )
6.  `stdint.h` is a header that provides fixed width integer types.
7.  You will be sure that no matter what platorm you compile/run it on, 
    the variable will always have a fixed number of bits.
8.  BYTE: 1 byte
    DWORD: 4 bytes
    LONG: 4 bytes
    WORD: 2 bytes
9.  42 4D
10. `bfSize` contains info about the type, size, and layout of a device-independant bitmap.
    `biSize` contains info about the dimensions and color format of a device-independant bitmap.
11. The bitmap is a top-down device-independant bitmap and its origin is the upper-left corner.
12. `biBitCount`
13. We don't have write permission to `outfile`. For example: 
    `./copy smiley /etc/shadow` and we aren't root.
14. This argument is the number of elements we want to read. Since we want 
    to read one element at a time, this argument is here always equal to 1.
15. `padding` will be 1.
16. `fseek` sets the position indicator. This allows you to go back or forward
    in a file.
17. `SEEK_CUR` is a constant that refers to the current position of the position indicator.
